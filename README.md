## üåü Overview

The **Netflix SQL Project** is a comprehensive **data analysis project** on Netflix‚Äôs movies and TV shows dataset. The project uses **PostgreSQL** to explore patterns, trends, and insights across various aspects of Netflix content.

Key highlights:

- Analyze **content distribution**: Movies vs TV Shows  
- Explore **popular genres, ratings, actors, and directors**  
- Identify **top producing countries** and content trends  
- Investigate **content release trends over the last 5‚Äì10 years**  
- Categorize content as **family-friendly or violent** using keyword analysis  

This project demonstrates practical **SQL skills** including aggregate functions, string and date manipulation, conditional logic, and analytical queries.

## üí° Business Problems & Solutions

Here‚Äôs an **interactive summary** of the queries and insights generated:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Movies vs TV Shows Count
```sql
SELECT type, COUNT(*) AS number_of_movies
FROM netflix
GROUP BY type;
```

‚úÖ **Insight**: Understand the distribution of movies and TV shows on Netflix.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Most Common Rating per Type
```sql
SELECT type, rating
FROM (
    SELECT type, rating, COUNT(*),
    RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY type ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS ranking
    FROM netflix
    GROUP BY type, rating
) AS t1
WHERE ranking = 1;
```

‚úÖ **Insight**: Find the most popular ratings (PG, TV-MA, etc.) in movies vs TV shows.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Movies Released in a Specific Year (e.g., 2020)
```sql
SELECT title
FROM netflix
WHERE type = 'Movie' 
  AND release_year = 2020;
```

‚úÖ **Insight**: Filter movies released in a specific year.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Top 5 Countries by Content Count
```sql
SELECT TRIM(UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(country, ','))) AS country,
       COUNT(show_id) AS total_content
FROM netflix
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY total_content DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

‚úÖ **Insight**: Identify which countries produce the most Netflix content (handles multiple countries per row).

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Identify the Longest Movie
```sql
SELECT *
FROM netflix
WHERE type = 'Movie'
  AND duration = (
    SELECT MAX(duration) FROM netflix WHERE type = 'Movie'
);
```

‚úÖ **Insight**: Find the movie with the longest runtime.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Find Content Added in Last 5 Years
```sql
SELECT *
FROM netflix
WHERE TO_DATE(date_added, 'Month DD, YYYY') >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '5 years';
```

‚úÖ **Insight**: Retrieve content that was added to Netflix in the last 5 years.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Movies / TV Shows by Director 'Rajiv Chilaka'
```sql
SELECT *
FROM netflix
WHERE director ILIKE '%Rajiv Chilaka%';
```

‚úÖ **Insight**: List all content (movies & TV shows) directed by Rajiv Chilaka.

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ TV Shows with More than 5 Seasons
```sql
SELECT *
FROM netflix
WHERE type = 'TV Show'
  AND SPLIT_PART(TRIM(duration), ' ', 1)::numeric > 5;
```

‚úÖ **Insight**: List TV shows having more than 5 seasons (uses TRIM to avoid spacing issues).

### 9Ô∏è‚É£ Count the Number of Content Items in Each Genre
```sql
SELECT TRIM(UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(listed_in, ','))) AS genre,
       COUNT(show_id) AS total_count
FROM netflix
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY total_count DESC;
```

‚úÖ **Insight**: Get how many items belong to each genre (splits multi-genre rows).

### üîü Yearly Content Percentage in India
```sql
SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM TO_DATE(date_added, 'Month DD, YYYY')) AS year,
       COUNT(*) AS yearly_content,
       ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM netflix WHERE country ILIKE '%India%'), 2) AS percentage_content
FROM netflix
WHERE country ILIKE '%India%'
  AND date_added IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
```

‚úÖ **Insight**: For each year, show total Indian content and that year‚Äôs percentage share of all Indian content.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ List All Movies That Are Documentaries

  AND release_year >= EXTRACT(YEAR FROM CURRENT_DATE) - 10;
```

‚úÖ **Insight**: Count/list movies that include Salman Khan released in the last 10 years (inclusive).

### 1Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£ Top 10 Actors in Indian Movies
```sql
SELECT TRIM(UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(casts, ','))) AS actor,
       COUNT(show_id) AS movies
FROM netflix
WHERE country ILIKE '%India%'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY movies DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

‚úÖ **Insight**: Identify actors who appear most frequently in Indian movies on Netflix.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£ Categorize Content as Bad or Good Based on Keywords
```sql
SELECT CASE

         ELSE 'Good_Content'
       END AS category,
       COUNT(*) AS total_count
FROM netflix
GROUP BY category;
```

‚úÖ **Insight**: Classify content by presence of violent keywords in descriptions and count per category.

## üß† Key Skills Demonstrated

Writing complex SQL queries with subqueries, aggregates, and window functions

Performing data cleaning and transformation using string and date functions

Categorizing data dynamically using CASE expressions

Handling multi-valued fields via ```sql STRING_TO_ARRAY``` + UNNEST (and TRIM)
